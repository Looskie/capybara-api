They have specialized jaw muscles that allow them to graze on tough vegetation.
Capybaras communicate through various vocalizations, including whistles, clicks, and chirps.
They have a scent gland on their nose called the morrillo, which they use to mark their territory.
Capybaras have a highly developed sense of hearing and can detect low-frequency sounds.
They have adapted to a semi-aquatic lifestyle with eyes, ears, and nostrils positioned on top of their head, allowing them to stay partially submerged in water while keeping a lookout for predators.
Capybaras have sharp incisor teeth that continuously grow throughout their lives.
They can reach speeds of up to 35 kilometers per hour (22 miles per hour) on land.
Capybaras engage in playful behavior, often chasing each other and rolling in the mud.
They have a flexible nose that can close underwater to prevent water from entering their nasal passages.
Capybaras have a relatively low body temperature, ranging from 36.5 to 38.3 degrees Celsius (97.7 to 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit).
They have a complex social hierarchy within their groups, with individuals establishing dominance through various behaviors.
Capybaras have a large cecum in their digestive system, aiding in the fermentation of cellulose and extraction of nutrients.
They have slightly webbed toes, which assist in swimming and navigating marshy habitats.
Capybaras have a high tolerance for temperature extremes, adapting well to both hot and cold environments.
They can produce vocalizations that sound like a purring cat when they are content.
Capybaras have a strong maternal instinct, with females providing care and protection for their young.
They have a long gestation period of around 150 days before giving birth.
Capybaras have a tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer behind their retina, which enhances their night vision.
They have a relatively low metabolic rate, allowing them to conserve energy in their herbivorous lifestyle.
Capybaras have slightly flattened heads, which help them stay submerged while keeping their eyes, ears, and nostrils above water.
They have a long and flexible muzzle that enables them to reach vegetation in the water easily.
Capybaras have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from tough and fibrous plants efficiently.
They have specialized teeth called hypsodont teeth, which continue to grow throughout their lives to compensate for the wear caused by their herbivorous diet.
Capybaras have a strong sense of social bonding and will often engage in nose-to-nose touching as a form of greeting and communication.
They have a distinctive scent that can be described as musky and is used for communication within their social group.
Capybaras have a thick layer of fat under their skin that acts as insulation, helping them regulate body temperature in different environments.
They are excellent at camouflaging themselves in their surroundings, blending in with vegetation to avoid detection by predators.
Capybaras have a well-developed memory and can remember the location of food sources and safe areas.
They have long, sturdy claws on their front feet that aid in digging burrows and manipulating food.
